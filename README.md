# LaFollett Labs — Claude Code Plugins

Claude Code plugin marketplace for [LaFollett Labs LLC](https://lafollettlabs.com).
Cross-project skills, commands, and developer workflow tools that work in any
repository.

## Available Plugins

Each plugin's README covers how to use it and the tips worth knowing before you
do.

| Plugin | What it does | |
| - | - | - |
| **code-reviewer** | Reviews that dispatch a principal engineer per stack — Go, Vue/Nuxt, AWS IaC, agent governance, dev tooling — then consolidate the findings | [Usage & tips](./plugins/code-reviewer/README.md) |
| **context-handoff** | Carry a session's working state, decisions, and next steps across a `/clear` | [Usage & tips](./plugins/context-handoff/README.md) |
| **issue-manager** | GitHub Issues that define what and why, never how — authored locally, pushed without duplicates | [Usage & tips](./plugins/issue-manager/README.md) |
| **plugin-janitor** | Remove cached plugin versions nothing points at, and the empty directories they leave | [Usage & tips](./plugins/plugin-janitor/README.md) |
| **session-analyzer** | Find, read, and measure your Claude Code sessions | [Usage & tips](./plugins/session-analyzer/README.md) |
| **ux-designer** | Design harness producing shippable code — parallel visual directions in isolated worktrees | [Usage & tips](./plugins/ux-designer/README.md) |
| **watchwith** | Watch a video *with* Claude — dense frames paired with the narration spoken over them | [Usage & tips](./plugins/watchwith/README.md) |

## Installation

Add the marketplace once:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lafollett-labs/lafollett-labs-claude-plugins
```

Then install whichever you want:

```
/plugin install code-reviewer
/plugin install context-handoff
/plugin install issue-manager
/plugin install plugin-janitor
/plugin install session-analyzer
/plugin install ux-designer
/plugin install watchwith
```

Updating is `/plugin marketplace update lafollett-labs-claude-plugins`. That
copies each bumped plugin into the cache and never sweeps the old ones, which is
what `plugin-janitor` is for.

### External dependencies

Most plugins need nothing beyond Claude Code. The exceptions:

| Plugin | Needs |
| - | - |
| `code-reviewer` | `gh` (PR reviews only) |
| `issue-manager` | `gh`, `node` |
| `ux-designer` | Playwright MCP server (optional — enables visual self-critique) |
| `watchwith` | `ffmpeg`; `deno` recommended. Python packages self-install on first run |

`code-reviewer` also ships five PE sub-agents under `agents/`, and `ux-designer`
ships `design-engineer`.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution flow, branch
naming, commit format, and authoring style guide.

### Adding a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with name, description, version, author
2. Add commands, skills, agents, or hooks under the plugin directory
3. Write `plugins/<name>/README.md` — what it does, how to use it, and the tips that are not obvious
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
5. Add the plugin to the table in this README
6. Add a `## [Unreleased]` entry to [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

### Versioning

Any edit under `plugins/<name>/` bumps that plugin's `plugin.json` version,
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`'s `metadata.version`, and CHANGELOG.md — all
three in the same commit. Without a bump, `/plugin marketplace update` sees no
difference and keeps serving the stale cached copy, so the change reaches
nobody.
