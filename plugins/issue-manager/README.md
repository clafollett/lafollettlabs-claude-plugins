# issue-manager

Create and manage GitHub Issues that define **what** and **why**, never **how**.
Author locally in markdown, push to GitHub, edit and push again without creating
duplicates.

```
/plugin install issue-manager
```

Needs `gh` authenticated and `node` on PATH.

| `/issue-manager:issue-manager` | create, import, update, and quality-check issues |

## Usage

```text
You: /issue-manager:issue-manager
You: create an epic for the billing migration with stories
You: import epic 582 so we can rework it
You: are these issues too implementation-heavy?
You: turn ADR-0007 into an epic
```

Everything lands in your repo, not the plugin directory:

```
docs/epics/004-slack-integration/
  00-Epic-Slack-Integration.md
  01-Story-Post-Digest-To-Channel.md
  02-Task-Rotate-Bot-Token.md
  .github-state.json           # filename -> issue number
```

### The two flows

**New work** — scaffold, write, push:

```
init --name "Slack Integration"        # creates the epic folder
                                        # you edit the markdown
create --docs-path docs/epics/004-...  # creates Issues, links children to the Epic
```

**Existing work** — pull down, rework, push back:

```
import --epic 582                      # Epic + children into local markdown
                                        # you rework it
update --docs-path docs/epics/582-...  # pushes edits by mapped issue number
status --docs-path docs/epics/582-...  # local vs GitHub sync state
```

## Tips

**The templates are the point.** Epic, Story, Task and Bug each carry a
quality gate: acceptance criteria must be observable outcomes, stories must be
INVEST, and code snippets, file paths, and library choices do not belong in an
issue unless they are an Epic-level architectural constraint.

**"The system should…" not "add a method that…".** The implementing engineer
decides the approach. An issue that specifies the implementation has pre-made a
decision the person with the most context has not made yet.

**`create` is idempotent.** It skips anything `.github-state.json` already maps,
so a partially-failed run is safe to re-run. Use `update` — not `create` — once
issues exist.

**Import before reworking anything already on GitHub.** Editing in the web UI
loses the local markdown as the source of truth, and the next `update` will
fight you.

**It stops after creating the Epic.** No branches, no implementation. Dispatching
the work is a separate decision from describing it.

**Epic folders are ordinal-prefixed** (`004-slack-integration`) and files are
`##-Type-Title.md` with `00` reserved for the Epic. The script reads that
convention — renaming files by hand breaks the mapping.
